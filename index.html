                 I received a job offer mid-course, 
                 and the subjects I learned were current, 
                 if not more so, 
                 in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                I’ve been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience 
                here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! 
                I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. 
                Since completing he course, 
                I’ve successfully switched careers, 
                working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. 
                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
                It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. \
                It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
